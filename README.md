#  ITRI616 - Diabetes Classification Project

##  Project Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of a machine learning classification project conducted as part of the **Artificial Intelligence 1 (ITRI616)** module at **North-West University (Vaal Triangle Campus)**. The objective was to build a predictive system capable of determining whether an individual has a **family history of diabetes** based on a mix of demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors.

The project follows a full ML pipeline ‚Äî from dataset selection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and reporting ‚Äî and reflects a realistic approach to healthcare data analysis.

##  Dataset Description

- **Source:** Kaggle  
  [Diabetes Prediction Dataset by MarshalPatel3558](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalpatel3558/diabetes-prediction-dataset)
- **License:** MIT (open for academic use)
- **Instances:** 10,000 rows  
- **Features:** 20 (including age, BMI, cholesterol levels, smoking status, etc.)
- **Target Variable:** `Family_History_of_Diabetes` (binary classification)

The dataset reflects real-world complexity, including missing values, class imbalance, and mixed feature types.

---

##  ML Algorithms Implemented

Four classification algorithms were developed and compared:

-  Decision Tree  
-  Random Forest  
-  Gradient Boosting Classifier  
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

##  Model Development Process

### 1. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- Missing value imputation (mode for categorical fields)
- One-hot encoding for multi-class categorical features
- Standardization using `StandardScaler` (for SVM)
- Class balancing using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)

### 2. **Train-Test Split**
- Stratified 80/20 split to preserve class distribution

### 3. **Model Training**
- Models were trained using default scikit-learn parameters
- No hyperparameter tuning was performed at this stage

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision-Recall Curve

###  Best Performing Model:
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier** achieved highest ROC AUC and F1-score.

See `figures/` folder for visualizations (e.g., ROC curves, PR curves).
